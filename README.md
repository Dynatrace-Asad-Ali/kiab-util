> **DISCLAIMER**: This project was developed for educational purposes only and is not complete, nor supported. It's publishment is only intended for helping others automate environments for delivering workshops with Keptn & Dynatrace. Even though the exposed endpoints of this cluster have valid SSL certificates generated with Cert-Manager and Let's Encrypt, does not mean the Box is secure.

## Get started in 1 - 2 - 3

## Create Dynatrace Token
Create Dynatrace API Token with the following permissions:
![Image of API V2](https://github.com/Dynatrace-Asad-Ali/keptn-in-a-box/blob/master/images/APIV2.png)
![Image of API V1](https://github.com/Dynatrace-Asad-Ali/keptn-in-a-box/blob/master/images/APIV1.png)
### Run it in an available machine  (manually)

#### 1. Log in into  your Ubuntu image
#### 2. Clone the repo and navigate to the directory

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dynatrace-Asad-Ali/keptn-in-a-box/master/keptn-in-a-box.sh
chmod +x keptn-in-a-box.sh
```
> You dont need to clone all the repo, only download the **keptn-in-a-box.sh** file. When executing it, it'll take care of the rest and load the resources from github.

#### 3. Execute the file with sudo rights.
```bash
sudo bash -c './keptn-in-a-box.sh &'
```
And that was it! Yes that easy!  Now if you notice is that there is an & in the command. This command will run installation in a bash shell as sudo, will prompt you for the password and will send the job to the background. You will not see any output since stdout and stderr are piped to a logfile which is located by default in **/tmp/kiab-install.log** 

For inspecting the installation on realtime type:
```bash
less +F /tmp/kiab-install.log
```

#####  The installed modules

The default installation is **installationBundlesDefault** which sets the control flag to true to the following modules:


```bash
  update_ubuntu=true
  docker_install=true
  microk8s_install=true
  setup_proaliases=true
  enable_k8dashboard=true
  istio_install=true
  helm_install=true
  keptn_install=true
  keptn_examples_clone=true
  resources_clone=true
  resources_route_istio_ingress=true
  dynatrace_savecredentials=true
  dynatrace_configure_monitoring=true


  keptndemo_teaser_pipeline=true
  keptndemo_cartsload=true
  keptndemo_unleash=true
  keptndemo_cartsonboard=true
  microk8s_expose_kubernetes_api=true
  microk8s_expose_kubernetes_dashboard=true
```

Dynatrace OneAgent and Dynatrace ActiveGate will be installed and configured if you provided your credentials. Otherwise they won't be installed. 

The script will install all the modules shown above and the github repository will be cloned in the home (~) directory of the sudo user that executed the script.

>The script was first created  to be run as root without an interactive shell since it is passed as userdata on creation of the elastic cloud machine via a python rest automation program.

## üí™Empower your Keptn-in-a-box üéÅ with Dynatrace by adding it's credentials

- Add the Dynatrace information to the variables:

	- TENANT="https://mytenant.live.dynatrace.com"
	- PAASTOKEN=myDynatracePaaSToken
	- APITOKEN=myDynatraceApiToken

     > For Tenant add it with protocol like:
     >  *https://{your-domain}/e/{your-environment-id}* 
     > for managed or 
     > https://{your-environment-id}.live.dynatrace.com 
     > for SaaS



Generate an API token and a PaaS token in your Dynatrace environment.
Make sure you have the **Access problem and event feed, metrics, and topology** switch enabled for the API token.

- [Kubernetes Workloads](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/technology-support/cloud-platforms/kubernetes/monitoring/monitor-workloads-kubernetes/)


With the **installationModulesDefault** or **installationModulesFull** Dynatrace is automatically installed if the credentials are configured.


## Other installation options
### Spin your preconfigured Keptn-in-a-box machines with userdata  (manually in aws)
1. Log in to AWS
2. Click on "Launch instance"
3. Select "Ubuntu Server [18|20].04 LTS (HVM) "
4. Choose your Instance Type "t2.xlarge" or 2xlarge recommended.
5. Select "Next - configure instance details"
6. In Configure Instance details - Advanced options (below) copy the keptn-in-a-box.sh file. (as string or drop it, doesn't matter). Remember to edit your file if you want to customize your box.
7. Review it and launch your instance.

### Spin your preconfigured Keptn-in-a-box machines  with userdata (automated)
- Description to be added. Please see the [Dynatrace Rest Tenant Automation project](https://github.com/sergiohinojosa/Dynatrace-REST-Tenant-Automation) for reference. The RTA project can spin as many instances as you want by providing a simple CSV file. It will also create and configure Dynatrace environments for each CSV entry, üòç perfect for delivering workshops üë®‚Äçüíª. If you are interested in a workshop get in contact with us. 


## üõ† Customizing your installation

The keptn-in-a-box project is highly customizable (obviously since it's a bashfile) below are some customizations that are the most used. All customizations can and should be done in the ** keptn-in-a-box.sh** file and not in the **functions.sh** file. This way you keep a nice delegation of tasks and functionality. 

### Change the installation Bundle
Comment out the Default and uncomment the installation type you want. For example for a Demo:

```bash
# ==================================================
#    ----- Select your installation Bundle -----   #
# ==================================================
# Uncomment for installing only Keptn 
# installationBundleKeptnOnly

# - Comment out if selecting another bundle
installationBundleDemo

# - Comment out if only want to install only the QualityGates functionality
#installationBundleKeptnQualityGates

# - Uncomment for installing Keptn-in-a-Box for Workshops
# installationBundleWorkshop

# - Uncomment below for installing all features
#installationBundleAll

# - Uncomment below for installing a PerformanceAsAService Box
#installationBundlePerformanceAsAService
```
This will install single node kubernetes cluster, keptn, k8 dashboard and expose the endpoints. It will also clone the examples, onboard the carts sample app and add a quality gate.  

### üèÅüö¶Performance as a Service  (installationBundlePerformanceAsAService)
This scenario will create a Box for delivering Performance as a Service in an instant. It will install the QualityGates functionality of Keptn  (not installing the other Keptn services and/or components such as Istio). It will install Jenkins preconfigured and managed as Code with 3 example pipelines. You only need to Tag your service in Dynatrace and (if wanting to do a loadtest) provide the URL of your application do a sample Loadtest and validate it. 
If you want to learn more about Qualitygates and SRE Driven development, take a look at the following tutorial:
https://tutorials.keptn.sh/tutorials/keptn-progressive-delivery-dynatrace/

#### The sample pipelines
<img src="doc/qualitygates.png" width="450px" title="Keptn-in-a-Box"> 

For example triggering the first quality gate and evaluating a service will look something like this:

<img src="doc/pipeline-validation.png" width="450px" title="Keptn-in-a-Box"> 

> Info: The first launch of the pipeline wil fail since they need to be initialized and they need parameters to do so. it is ok, on the second run, it will ask you for your information.


1. 01-qualitygate-evaluation -  will do only the evaluation of the given service and timeframe
2. 02-simpletest-qualitygate - will do a simple multi-step test directly from Jenkins via HTTP and do the validation via keptn.
3. 03-performancetest-qualitygate - will do a Loadtest based on a simple JMeter script. 

### Change your own Domain
By default the Script will get the public ip and give it a magic domain with nip.io like ip=1.2.3.4 will become 1-2-3-4.nip.io. This way with an NGINX Ingress Keptn and all Istio and Kubernetes services are available with subdomains via the standard HTTP ports 443 and 80.

This example could apply if I want to run a box in a VirtualMachine in my home network:
```bash
DOMAIN=192.168.0.1.nip.io
```

### üîí Generate valid certificates with Lets Encrypt 

By adding/commenting out the following control flags, you'll install Certmanager. A Cluster Issuer will be added and a valid certificate with let's encrypt for your public endpoints will be created. This way the exposed Endpoints/Services like the  Keptn API, Homepage, or Kubernetes API will have a valid Certificate. The Certificate renewal will happen automatically.

```bash
certmanager_install=true
certmanager_enable=true
```

If you provide your Email, the Cluster issuer will be created with the given email account. If left empty a fake Email account will be generated.

```bash
CERTMANAGER_EMAIL="youremail@yourdomain.com"
```

Add the modules before the `doInstallation` 

### üë®‚Äçüíª Create a Workshop user 
You might have notice the following variables:
```bash
NEWPWD="dynatrace"
NEWUSER="dynatrace"
```
This variables in combination with the control flag `create_workshop_user=false` will create a workshop user. It will clone the `USER` home directory and add hi configuration so the `NEWUSER` can also interact with `keptn`, `docker` and `kubectl`. An SSH Password will be configured and allowed.

###  Change the Version of a component
This are the actual versions of the different Modules
```bash
# **** Installation Versions **** 
# ==================================================
#      ----- Components Versions -----             #
# ==================================================
ISTIO_VERSION=1.5.1
CERTMANAGER_VERSION=0.14.0
KEPTN_VERSION=0.7.0
KEPTN_JMETER_SERVICE_VERSION=0.2.0
KEPTN_DT_SERVICE_VERSION=0.8.0
KEPTN_DT_SLI_SERVICE_VERSION=0.5.0
KEPTN_EXAMPLES_BRANCH=0.7.0
TEASER_IMAGE="shinojosa/nginxacm:0.7"
KEPTN_BRIDGE_IMAGE="keptn/bridge2:20200326.0744"
MICROK8S_CHANNEL="1.18/stable"
KEPTN_IN_A_BOX_DIR="~/keptn-in-a-box"
KEPTN_EXAMPLES_DIR="~/examples"
KEPTN_IN_A_BOX_REPO="https://github.com/keptn-sandbox/keptn-in-a-box"
KEPTN_IN_A_BOX_DIR="~/keptn-in-a-box"
KEPTN_EXAMPLES_DIR="~/examples"
```
Feel free to experiment and change the versions. We will try to keep the list up to date. 

###  Create your custom installation
At the begining of the  `functions.sh` file the installation modules are listed. You can enable them in the `keptn-in-a-box.sh` file before calling the `doInstallation` function.

### Troubleshooting and inspecting the installation
To Inspect do 

```bash
less +F /tmp/kiab-install.log
```
and to have a verbose output (of every executed command) set the following control flag `verbose_mode=true` 


## DeepDive into the project (understanding how Microk8s, NGINX Ingress routing, Istio and Keptn work together)

This project was first presented to the Keptn Community in a Keptn Developer Meeting on the 23rd of April 2020.
